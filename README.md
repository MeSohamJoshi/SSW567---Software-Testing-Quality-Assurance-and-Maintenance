# triangle-classifier
write a program in Python to classify triangles and use an automated test platform, e.g. UnitTest or PyTest, and write test cases to test your implementation of classifying triangles.  The goal is for you to gain experience using automated test tools and to think through the issues associated with testing a "system".
